## Agile Methodology

This project was planned using Agile project management through Epics, Descriptions, User Stories, Story Points, MoSCoW prioritization, Acceptance Criteria, and Tasks.

A Kanban board has been set up and used for this purpose, providing an organized overview. It can be accessed at: [https://github.com/users/linobollansee/projects/6](https://github.com/users/linobollansee/projects/6)

### User Stories

Please read this section thoroughly, as it includes important and comprehensive information on how the User Stories and their Tasks were accomplished for this project.

User Story 1.1: Design Front-End for a Data-Driven Web Application (Must Have, Story Points: 5)
- Description: As a user, I want a user-friendly front-end that follows accessibility guidelines and UX principles so that I can easily interact with the application.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Front-end meets UX and accessibility guidelines.
    - Wireframes, mockups, and diagrams are documented.
  - Tasks:
    - Create wireframes and mockups for the front-end design.
    - Design HTML templates with consistent structure.
    - Implement CSS for responsive design.
    - Review and validate the front-end design against accessibility standards.
  - How Tasks were respectively completed:
    - Balsamiq software was used to create the wireframes, and web browser screenshots were taken for the mockups.
    - The {% extends 'base.html' %} tag was used to create a consistent structure throughout the Django templates by inheriting the base layout.
    - The Bootstrap Framework with predefined grid classes with built-in responsive design was used to implement CSS for responsive design.
    - Google Lighthouse was utilized to assess and verify the front-end design's compliance with accessibility standards.

User Story 1.2: Plan Agile Development Using an Agile Tool (Must Have, Story Points: 8)
- Description: As a developer, I want to plan and track all tasks and user stories in an Agile tool so that I can manage the project efficiently.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - All user stories, epics, and tasks documented in the Agile tool.
  - Tasks:
    - Set up an Agile tool for task tracking.
    - Document all user stories, epics, and tasks in the tool.
    - Create a project board with priorities.
  - How Tasks were respectively completed:
    - A new GitHub project was started to be used as an Agile tool.
    - GitHub project issues were created to document user stories, epics, and tasks.
    - GitHub project labels with MoSCoW criteria were applied to create a project board with priorities.

User Story 1.3: Ensure Code Quality Standards (Must Have, Story Points: 3)
- Description: As a developer, I want the code to conform to PEP8 and validated HTML/CSS/Javascript standards so that the application maintains high-quality and consistent coding practices.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Python code conforms to PEP8 standards.
    - HTML, CSS, Javascript code are validated.
  - Tasks:
    - Implement a code review process.
    - Use tools for Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript validation.
  - How Tasks were respectively completed:
    - The list of files to be checked was prepared, including all `*.html`, `*.css`, `*.js`, `*.py` files essential to this project.
    - Python code was checked with the Code Institute linter, HTML with the W3C Markup Validation Service, CSS with The W3C CSS Validation Service, Javascript with the JSHint JavaScript Code Quality Tool.

User Story 2.1: Build the Data Model and Database Structure (Must Have, Story Points: 5)
- Description: As a developer, I want to implement a database model that supports the applicationâ€™s business logic and data manipulation needs.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - A well-structured data model exists for storing and retrieving data.
    - At least one custom model is implemented.
  - Tasks:
    - Design a database schema that fits the project domain.
    - Implement the database model.
    - Create migrations to initialize the database structure.
  - How Tasks were respectively completed:
    - An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to design a database schema that fits the project domain.
    - Database models were implemented through `models.py` files with field declarations in app folders.
    - Running the following commands in the terminal: `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` initialized the database structure. It executes the SQL commands through the migration files.

User Story 2.2: Implement CRUD Functionality (Must Have, Story Points: 5)
- Description: As a user, I want to create, update, read, and delete data so that I can manage my information within the application.
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - All CRUD actions are functional.
    - Data changes are immediately reflected in the UI.
  - Tasks:
    - Build the back-end logic for CRUD operations.
    - Design forms for data input with validation.
    - Ensure changes to data are reflected on the front-end.
  - How Tasks were respectively completed:
    - Designing the back-end logic for CRUD operations involved defining `models.py` files to represent data structures, creating `views.py` files to handle the logic for displaying and processing data, `forms.py` for user input validation, setting up `urls.py` files to map requests to the appropriate views, and creating templates to render the HTML presentation.
    - The forms.py files were created and include a Meta class with attributes designed to validate data input.
    - The messages framework was imported with `from django.contrib import messages` in the views files in order to display notifications to users when data changes are made.
